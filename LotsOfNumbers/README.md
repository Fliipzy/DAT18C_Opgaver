# Lots of Numbers

**_Exercise 1_**
- Design a class with main(){}
- Design a class to handle numbers from -∞ to ∞

**_Exercise 2_**

An object from this Number class must “contain” all or
a subset of this numbers. F.ex. could an object “contain”
all numbers in an interval [0.0 ; 1.2].
“contain” indicate that, when the object is asked about a
value is included or not, it must answer correct.


**Exercise 3**

This Number class must of course include :
- equals()
- toString()

How do you decide, when 2 objects from this Number
class is equal?

**Exercise 4**

Set up a couple of test routines, that is try to catch
errors in your code.

**Exercise 5**

Rethink Exercise 1 – 4 so you can include objects, that
only allows whole numbers (i.e. integers (int))
