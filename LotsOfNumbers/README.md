# Lots of Numbers

**Exercise 1**
- Design a class with main(){}
- Design a class to handle numbers from -∞ to ∞

**Exercise 2**
- An object from this Number class must “contain” all or
a subset of this numbers. F.ex. could an object “contain”
all numbers in an interval [0.0 ; 1.2].
“contain” indicate that, when the object is asked about a
value is included or not, it must answer correct.


**Exercise 3**

This Number class must of course include :
- equals()
- toString()
